Hi
In this project, we designed a messenger like Telegram or WhatsApp, where you can send messages to different people who are members.
For this purpose,we have used the c++ programming language, object-oriented thinking,and the QT framework.
Our project has 3 main parts which include the following:

First, a page to select the desired activity:
